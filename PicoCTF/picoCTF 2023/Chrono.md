# chrono Writeup

This one's nice to learn the basics of `cron` in Linux, I'm a little familiar with it so I tried accessing the crontab because if text is going to be somewhere it's on the crontab, the place where you list the cron instructions.

Remember you can find this info on Google easily, don't worry if you never heard of cron.

`crontab -l` wasn't working so after Googling a bit I found that you can access the file with `cat /etc/crontab` and that's it!

There was the flag: `picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_1b4d8744}`
